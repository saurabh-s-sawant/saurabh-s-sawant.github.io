Practice GPU kernels with CUDA for common operations.

| Code             || Preprocessor Flags     || Brief description |
| :--------------- || :--------------------- || :---------------- |
| [matrix multiplication](https://github.com/saurabh-s-sawant/gpu_exer/blob/main/practice_codes/matrix_mult/matmul.cu) || `NAIVE`           || simplest, high latency     |
|                       || `TILED`           || 2D tiling                  |
|                       || `TILED_COARSENED` || 2D tiling + thread coarsening |
| [convolution](https://github.com/saurabh-s-sawant/gpu_exer/blob/main/practice_codes/convolution/convolution.cu) || `NAIVE`           || simplest, high latency     |
|                       || `CONSTMEM`           || constant memory for filter |
|                       || `TILED_CONSTANTMEM_TYPE_1` ||`CONSTMEM` + 2D tiling with more threads than output tile |
|                       || `TILED_CONSTANTMEM_TYPE_2` ||`CONSTMEM` + 2D tiling with fewer threads than input tile |
|                       || `TILED_CONSTANTMEM_CACHEHALO` || `TILED_CONSTANTMEM_TYPE_2` with halo cells loaded from memory (L2 cache) |
| [transpose](https://github.com/saurabh-s-sawant/gpu_exer/blob/main/practice_codes/transpose/transpose.cu) || `NAIVE`          || simplest, thread coarsening, high latency   |
|                       || `CORNER_TURNING`     || thread coarsening + tiling with corner turning |
|                       || `NO_BANK_CONFLICT` ||`CORNER_TURNING` without bank conflicts |
| [image rotation](https://github.com/saurabh-s-sawant/gpu_exer/blob/main/practice_codes/image_rotation/image_rotate.cu) || `NAIVE`          || simplest, thread coarsening, high latency     |
|                       || `CORNER_TURNING`     || thread coarsening + similar to corner turning without bank conflicts |

|                       || `REGISTERTILING_THREADCOARSENING`     || 2D tiling with smart use of registers |
| [streams](https://github.com/saurabh-s-sawant/gpu_exer/blob/main/practice_codes/streams/streams.cu) || -             || overlapping kernel with cudaMemcpyAsync     |
| [histogram](https://github.com/saurabh-s-sawant/gpu_exer/blob/main/practice_codes/histogram/histogram.cu) || `NAIVE`             || simplest, high contention     |

|                       || `THREADCOARSENING_INTERLEAVED`     || `PRIVATIZATION` + threadcoarsening with interleaved accesses for better memory coalescing |
|                       || `AGGREGATION`     || `THREADCOARSENING_INTERLEAVED` + with accumulator (best for non-uniform distribution of data) |
| [reduction](https://github.com/saurabh-s-sawant/gpu_exer/blob/main/practice_codes/reduction/reduction.cu) || `NAIVE`             || simplest, single block, control divergence     |
