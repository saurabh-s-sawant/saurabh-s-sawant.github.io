<div align="justify">
My primary interest lies in high-perfomance computing for scientific applications.
In the past ten years, I have developed scalable C++ software for applications ranging from nanoelectronics to hypersonics using particle-based as well as matrix-based numerical methods.

In my current role as a postdoctoral scholar at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, I am leading an effort on developing exascale electrostatic--quantum transport solver, eXstatic, for modeling next-generation nanoscale field effect transistors. The code employs the nonequilibrium Green's function method to capture quantum effects in nanodevices. Prior to this work, I contributed to the development of software stack for electrodynamic applications in microelectronics.

I earned my Ph.D. in the Aerospace Engineering from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I developed massively scalable software for solving the Boltzmann Transport equation using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method to study instabilities in hypersonic flows. 
In addition, I developed software for implementing data-driven methods such as proper orthogonal decomposition and solving eigenvalue problems arising from the linear stability analysis of fluid flows.</div>
