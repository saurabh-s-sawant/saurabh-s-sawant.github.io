I am passionate about tackling complex scientific challenges that have a meaningful and far-reaching impact. Trained as a computational scientist, I thrive on collaborating with experts from varied backgrounds, including theoreticians and experimentalists, to solve challenging problems.

Central to most of my projects is high-performance computing (HPC). Over the past decade, I have honed my skills in developing scalable C++ software tailored for a wide range of scientific applications, spanning from hypersonics to nanoelectronics. My expertise encompasses both particle-based and matrix-based numerical methods, enabling me to address diverse problems.

In my current role as a postdoctoral scholar at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, I lead the development of an exascale electrostatic-quantum transport solver for modeling nanomaterials. Leveraging the nonequilibrium Green's function method & HPC, our code enables analysis of charge transport within intricate 3D structures. Prior to this endeavor, I worked on electrodynamic modeling of microelectronic circuits using Maxwell's equations.

I earned my M.S. and Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I worked on modeling hypersonic flows.
I lead the development of massively scalable software for solving the Boltzmann Transport equation, using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. 
Using this tool, I studied challenging problems at the intersection of statistical mechanics, hypersonics, and linear stability analysis, such as modeling 3D shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions.
